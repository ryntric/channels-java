/**
 * A high-performance {@link ProducerWaitStrategy} that uses CPU-level spin-waiting

 * <p>
 * This strategy is designed for low-latency scenarios where minimal wake-up
 * delay is critical. The producer continuously spins without yielding or blocking,
 * maximizing responsiveness at the cost of higher CPU usage.
 * </p>
 *
 * Characteristics
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Very low latency due to immediate spin-resume.</li>
 *   <li>High CPU usage if the buffer has no available capacity.</li>
 *   <li>Does not rely on external signaling â€” the producer continuously polls.</li>
 * </ul>
