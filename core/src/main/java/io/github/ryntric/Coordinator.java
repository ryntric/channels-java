/**
 * Coordinates the interaction between producers and consumers in a {@link Channel}
 * or {@link RingBuffer}, managing how each side waits when no work is available.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Coordinator} delegates waiting and signaling behavior to the configured
 * {@link ProducerWaitStrategy} and {@link ConsumerWaitStrategy}, allowing fine-grained
 * control over latency and CPU utilization.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Typical usage involves invoking {@link #producerWait()} when a producer cannot
 * advance due to capacity constraints, and {@link #consumerWait()} when a consumer
 * has no available data. The {@link #wakeupConsumer()} method signals blocked or
 * parked consumers that new data has arrived.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Characteristics</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Thread-safe: multiple producers and consumers can safely share a single coordinator.</li>
 *   <li>Wait strategies are pluggable and configurable per use case.</li>
 *   <li>Supports signaling for blocking consumers and efficient spinning/yielding for others.</li>
 * </ul>
