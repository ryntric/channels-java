 * A {@link ProducerWaitStrategy} that yields the CPU when the producer cannot advance.
 * <p>
 * By invoking {@link Thread#yield()}, the producer thread hints to the scheduler
 * that it is willing to yield its current time slice, allowing other threads to run.
 * This provides a middle ground between spinning and parking, balancing latency
 * and CPU usage.
 * </p>

 * Characteristics
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Lower CPU usage than spinning, but slightly higher latency.</li>
 *   <li>Does not block the thread.</li>
 *   <li>Does not rely on signaling â€” the producer continuously polls.</li>
