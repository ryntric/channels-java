/**
 * A low-power {@link ConsumerWaitStrategy} that uses {@link LockSupport#parkNanos(long)}
 * to briefly park the consumer thread when no data is available.
 * <p>
 * This strategy is useful when balancing power efficiency and latency is important.
 * The consumer thread yields control to the operating system for a very short time
 * (1 nanosecond) rather than busy-spinning, reducing CPU load while maintaining
 * relatively fast wake-up times.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This implementation is <b>non-signallable</b>; the {@link #signal()} method is
 * intentionally a no-op because the parked thread will resume automatically on its
 * next iteration. It is most effective when used in continuous polling loops.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Characteristics</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Low CPU usage compared to spinning or yielding.</li>
 *   <li>Suitable for continuously running consumer threads.</li>
 *   <li>Does not rely on external signaling â€” park duration controls backoff.</li>
 * </ul>
