/**
 * A {@link ConsumerWaitStrategy} that yields the CPU when no data is available.
 * <p>
 * This strategy is a middle ground between spinning and blocking. By invoking
 * {@link Thread#yield()}, the consumer thread hints to the scheduler that it is
 * willing to yield its current time slice, allowing other threads to run.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This implementation is <b>non-signallable</b>; the {@link #signal()} method
 * is intentionally a no-op. The consumer thread resumes automatically in the next
 * iteration of its polling loop.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Characteristics</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Lower CPU usage than spinning, but slightly higher latency.</li>
 *   <li>Does not block the thread.</li>
 *   <li>Does not rely on signaling â€” the consumer continuously polls.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @see ConsumerWaitStrategy
 * @see Thread#yield()
