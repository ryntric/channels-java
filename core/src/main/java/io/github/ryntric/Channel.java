/**
 * A high-performance, lock-free message channel built on top of a {@link RingBuffer}.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Channel} class provides an abstraction for exchanging data between
 * producers and consumers with minimal latency. It supports multiple concurrency
 * configurations such as SPSC (single-producer/single-consumer), MPSC (multi-producer/
 * single-consumer), SPMC (single-producer/multi-consumer), and MPMC (multi-producer/
 * multi-consumer) through specialized {@link Sequencer} and {@link Poller}
 * implementations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Producers publish items using {@link #push(Object)} or {@link #push(Object[])}.
 * Consumers retrieve items using {@link #receive(int, Consumer)} or
 * {@link #blockingReceive(int, Consumer)}.
 * The {@link Coordinator} controls the wait strategies for both sides, allowing
 * fine-grained tuning of CPU utilization and latency characteristics.</p>
 *
 * Usage Example
 * <pre>{@code
 * Channel<String> channel = Channel.mpsc(
 *     1024,
 *     ProducerWaitStrategyType.SPINNING,
 *     ConsumerWaitStrategyType.BLOCKING
 * );
 *
 * // Producer
 * channel.push("Hello");
 *
 * // Consumer
 * channel.blockingReceive(64, msg -> System.out.println("Received: " + msg));
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of element stored in this channel
