/**
 * An abstract base implementation of the {@link Sequencer} interface providing
 * common functionality for sequence coordination in a ring buffer or similar
 * high-throughput data structure.
 *
 * <p>This class manages two key sequence counters:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #cursorSequence} – tracks the latest published sequence.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #gatingSequence} – tracks the minimum sequence of consumers.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementations are responsible for defining how sequences are claimed,
 * published, and coordinated between producers and consumers. This base class
 * provides thread-safe primitives for advancing and publishing gating sequences,
 * as well as waiting for sequence availability.</p>
 *
 * <p>All sequence updates are performed using release/acquire semantics to ensure
 * correct visibility and ordering in concurrent environments.</p>
